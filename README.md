# tscipherlib

This code was forked from https://github.com/tomrow/tscipherlib and converted into PHP.

basic weak cipher

It has 4 functions:
  - encodeTs (not yet fully tested)
  - decipherTs
  - scrambleTs
  - newmod (modulo function to bypass PHP's modulo implamentation)


It can be run standalone, and has a basic HTML form set up to enter an encrypted string and key. At a later date, I will implement encoding functions aswell.
